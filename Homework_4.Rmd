```{r homework parte uno, message=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
a <- 3
b <- 2
print(a+b)
sum(a,b)
```

```{r homework parte dos}
library("nycflights13")
```
now we're going to make the AA data frame

```{r homework parte tres}
data("flights")
names(flights)
head(flights)
AA_flights <- filter(flights, carrier == "AA")

ggplot(data = AA_flights) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay))
```
