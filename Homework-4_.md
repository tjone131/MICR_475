``` r
library("tidyverse")
a <- 3
b <- 2
sum(a,b)
```

    ## [1] 5

``` r
library("nycflights13")
```

now weâ€™re going to make the AA data frame

``` r
data("flights")
AA_flights <- filter(flights, carrier == "AA")

ggplot(data = AA_flights) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay))
```
