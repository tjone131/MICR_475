Our group is creating an analysis tool to fit the predicted decay rates
of degrading compounds from oil spills to the actual decomposition data
taken from our dataset.

The planned workflow is to have each of us work separetly and routinely
check in by sharing each otherâ€™s code.

The elements in this project will include a package with functions for
calculating A and K values, predicited values and plot outputs
