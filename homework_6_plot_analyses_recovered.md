In this plot, the data named toxoplasma infection outcome is shown on
the Y axis with socioeconomic status on the X axis. This plot is “bad”
for several reasons. the first being that the axis labels are way too
general and do not indicate what exactly is being measured as far as
infection outcome (is this a yes or no, a binary system?) with no
indication of those details, this plot is a “bad plot”. Also, there is
not a clear understanding as to how socioeconomic status is measured
1-8. This plot is just not detailed enough nor is it visually appealing.
I also recall red and blue on the same plot being an issue for those who
are colorblind.

Improvement of this plot could be easily executed with a figure legend
that is detailed and a less mouthy title. There could also be better
axis titles that give the reader information to actually understand the
data presented. The two lines don’t need to be there if there is a
relationship between the two plotted variables is shown in one line.
